For each $(x_1,x_2)\in X_1\times X_2$, let $U_1$ and $U_2$ be the open sets containing $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively, such that $p_i^{-1}(U_i)$ is a union of disjoint open sets, each of which is homeomorphic to $U_i$.
Then $U_1\times U_2$ is the open set containing $x$ such that $(p_1\times p_2)^{-1}(U_1\times U_2)$ is a union of disjoint open sets, each of which is homeomorphic to $U_1 \times U_2$.

Let $f:X\rightarrow S^1$ be the map.
Since $f^*(\pi_1(X))$ has to be a finite subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$ and is therefore the trivial group, $f$ could be lifted to $\tilde{f}:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$.
Then $f$ is nullhomotopic since $\tilde{f}$ is.

That is, $i_\sharp(\sigma) - i_\sharp(\tau)$ is boundary implies $\sigma - \tau$ is a boundary.
It suffices to prove that $i_\sharp(\sigma)$ is boundary then $\sigma$ is boundary.
Let $\partial \sigma_Y = i_\sharp(\sigma)$.
Then $\partial (r_\sharp(\sigma_Y)) = r_\sharp (\partial\sigma_Y) = r_\sharp (i_\sharp (\sigma)) = \sigma$ since $ri = \operatorname{id}$.

If
\[ \partial P + P \partial = g_\sharp - f_\sharp \]
and
\[ \partial Q + Q \partial = h_\sharp - g_\sharp \]
then
\[ \partial (P+Q) + (P+Q)\partial = h_\sharp - f_\sharp \]
and therefore the relation is transitive.
It's clear that the relation is reflective (by $P\rightarrow -P$) and symmetric ($P=0$).
