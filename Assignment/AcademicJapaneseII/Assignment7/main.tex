淸興るに及び、\\
As the Qing dynasty rose,\\
明の性理學の反動として、\\
as a reaction against Neo-Confucianism of Ming,\\
學問に復古的の傾向を帶び來たり、\\
in academics there shows a revivalist trend, and\\
乾隆以來は純粹なる漢學といふ一の學派が出來た譯であるが、\\
that's why since the Qianlong period a school called pure Han study emerged, and\\
乾隆より嘉慶に至り尤も盛なりしは、\\
from Qianlong to Jiaqing the most flourishing period was when\\
賈逵\textperiodcentered 許愼\textperiodcentered 馬融\textperiodcentered 鄭玄といふ如き東漢の古文學者を祖述し、\\
they succeed the Old School Text scholars of the Eastern Han dynasty like Jia Kui, Xu Shen, Ma Rong and Zheng Xuan, and\\
其學說を闡明にするを目的としたるものにて、\\
they are the ones who had taken as their aim to clarify their theories, and\\
嚴宻に言へば之れを東漢學と稱すべきものなり。\\
in precise terms this is what one must refer to as Eastern Han study.

それが道光以後になれば公羊學が起り、\\
After the Daoguang period the study of Gong Yang Zhuan emerged, and\\
經學は西漢博士の傳へたるもの尤も信ずべく、\\
among the study of Confucian classics (people) certainly believe the most those the scholars of the West Han Scholars had passed down, and\\
東漢の學は西漢の學の如く師承明ならず、\\
as for the study of Eastern Han, the lineage is not as clear as the study of Western Han, and\\
殊に鄭玄の如きは種々の學派を取入れたるものにて、\\
in particular people like Zheng Xuan are the ones that had incorporated various schools, and\\
家法もなければ師法もなく、\\
if there is no family code then there is also no master's teachings, and\\
全く經學を毀したるものと、罵倒するものさへ出で來れり。\\
even the derogatory remarks like ``the one who had ruined the study of Confucian classics in total'' started to appear.
